# CIVIL3D-LISP-COLLECTION
A collection of Civil3D Lisp routines, both new and old.  As long as it works and I can legally put it here, I will be putting it here.

My goal is specifically for older, unpopular scripts as many older forums could be at risk of deletion (looking at you Autodesk with your forum deletion...) and I do not want those to be lost.

If you find a error in a program, or beleive that one should not be included in this collection, please let me know and I will try to address it.
